					'Awarded Forbes 30 Under 30 in Consumer Technology and South Florida’s Top Working Professional by the Sun Suntinel Sergey Petrossov is always seeking ways to innovate industries.',
					'Prior to JetSmarter, he co-founded two IT projects: an online chat system for website customer service and a distance-learning platform for Russian-speaking educational institutions. He also served as a board advisor to a South Florida-based private jet operator that, at the time, had the world’s largest on-demand Gulfstream charter fleet.',
					'When Petrossov flew private for the first time he immediately identified challenges with the antiquated, brick-and-mortar approach to booking charter flights. Mobile marketplaces were on the rise, and he felt certain that the cumbersome private aviation booking process could be solved with technology – thus, the idea for JetSmarter was born.',
					'After gathering his development team from previous projects and investing his own capital, Petrossov began the planning phase for an app that could connect flyers with top-rated private jet operators. The beta-version of JetSmarter launched in August 2012 as a proof of concept for select users. After raising additional funding and collaborating with hundreds of vendors and partners, Petrossov officially launched the JetSmarter app to the public in March 2013.',
					'JetSmarter’s skillful technology, management, and advisory teams – many of whom are credited with successful project execution for NASA, Nokia, Microsoft, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Uber – bring a combined experience of more than 100 years in technology, private air travel and logistics to the table. It is their unceasing hard work combined with Petrossov’s vision that gave birth to the groundbreaking app JetSmarter is today.'
